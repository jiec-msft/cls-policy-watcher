# Windows ARM64 Build Configuration Summary

## 🔧 **Fixed Configuration**

### **Main Build Job**
```yaml
build:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - os: windows-latest
          node: 20.x
          arch: arm64  # ARM64 target

  steps:
    # ✅ Fixed: Use x64 Node.js (not arm64)
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20.x
        architecture: x64  # Host architecture

    # ✅ Fixed: Use x64 MSBuild (not arm64)  
    - name: Setup MSBuild (Windows)
      uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.3
      with:
        msbuild-architecture: x64  # Host architecture

    # ✅ Added: Cross-compilation environment
    - name: Setup Windows ARM64 cross-compilation
      if: matrix.arch == 'arm64'
      run: |
        echo "npm_config_target_arch=arm64" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV
        echo "npm_config_target_platform=win32" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV
        echo "npm_config_arch=arm64" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV

    # ✅ Enhanced: Build with target arch
    - name: Build native addon
      run: npm run rebuild
      env:
        npm_config_build_from_source: true
        npm_config_target_arch: ${{ matrix.arch == 'arm64' && 'arm64' || '' }}
```

### **Prebuild Job**
```yaml
prebuild:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - os: windows-latest
          arch: arm64

  steps:
    # ✅ Same x64 host configuration
    - name: Setup Node.js
      architecture: x64
    
    - name: Setup MSBuild (Windows)  
      msbuild-architecture: x64
```

## 🎯 **Key Principles**

### **Host vs Target Architecture**
```
Host Environment (GitHub Runner):
├── OS: Windows x64
├── Node.js: x64
├── MSBuild: x64
└── Python: x64

Target Architecture:
├── Compilation Target: ARM64
├── Output Binary: ARM64
└── Environment Variables: arm64
```

### **Why This Works**
1. **MSBuild x64**: Can cross-compile to ARM64 using MSVC toolchain
2. **Node.js x64**: Provides stable build environment  
3. **Environment Variables**: Tell node-gyp to target ARM64
4. **MSVC Toolchain**: Automatically selected for ARM64 cross-compilation

## 📊 **Build Matrix Status**

| Platform | Host Arch | Target Arch | Node.js | MSBuild | Status |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Windows x64 | x64 | x64 | x64 | x64 | ✅ Native |
| **Windows ARM64** | **x64** | **arm64** | **x64** | **x64** | ✅ **Cross-compile** |
| Linux x64 | x64 | x64 | x64 | N/A | ✅ Native |
| Linux ARM64 | arm64 | arm64 | arm64 | N/A | ✅ Native |
| macOS x64 | x64 | x64 | x64 | N/A | ✅ Native |
| macOS ARM64 | arm64 | arm64 | arm64 | N/A | ✅ Native |

## 🚀 **Expected Build Output**

For Windows ARM64, the build should now:
1. ✅ Setup x64 Node.js successfully
2. ✅ Setup x64 MSBuild successfully  
3. ✅ Configure ARM64 cross-compilation environment
4. ✅ Compile native addon for ARM64 target
5. ✅ Run tests (if compatible)
6. ✅ Generate prebuild package

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If builds still fail, check:
- MSVC ARM64 toolchain is installed on runner
- Environment variables are correctly set
- node-gyp supports the Node.js version for ARM64 cross-compilation

This configuration follows Microsoft's recommended practices for ARM64 cross-compilation on Windows! 🎯
